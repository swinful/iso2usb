There are several ways to do this, but here are just two ways that I use regularly. Please replace /dev/sr1 with the device identifier of your target drive (find out what it is with inxi -d), and replace myiso with your iso and its disk location if necessary.

    wodim -eject -tao  speed=2 dev=/dev/sr1 -v -data myiso.iso

    growisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/sr1=myiso.iso

More information about the read and write capabilities of your drive can be found with the following command, again substututing my example /dev with your device identifier:

wodim -prcap dev=/dev/sr1

For more options relating to wodim and growisofs, see their respective manpages, by entering man wodim and man growisofs. (Note: wodim is a fork of the original cdrecord program)
